        No specific <strong>Gibson</strong> model carries more intrigue and gravitas than the 1959 Les Paul Standard. While it became the most iconic guitar in history, it wasn’t a successful model when it was released (under 650 were made). But before long it was adopted by some of the world’s greatest guitarists — Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Mike Bloomfield, Billy Gibbons, Joe Perry and Slash to name a few. The instrument was simply enchanting, from its beautiful figured maple top to its extreme sonic versatility.

        “It has a deep, powerful sound and you can use it to imitate just about anything – violin, sax, cello, even a sitar,” says Jeff Beck.

            The <strong>Fender Stratocaster</strong> is a model of electric guitar designed from 1952 into 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and completed by Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster from 1954 to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top “horn” shape for balance like the Precision Bass guitar. 
            Along with the Gibson Les Paul and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes. “Stratocaster” and “Strat” are trademark terms belonging to Fender. Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster by other manufacturers are usually called S-Type or ST-type guitars

            The <strong>Fender Telecaster</strong>, colloquially known as the Tele , is the world’s first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.
            Just like the Fender Stratocaster, the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, punk, and heavy metal.

            The <strong>Gibson ES-335</strong> is the world’s first commercial thinline archtop semi-acoustic electric guitar (also known as “semi-hollowbody”). Released by the Gibson Guitar Corporation as part of its ES (Electric Spanish) series in 1958, it is neither fully hollow nor fully solid; instead, a solid maple wood block runs through the center of its body. The side “wings” formed by the two “cutaways” into its upper bouts are hollow, and the top has two violin-style f-holes over the hollow chambers.
            Notable users include Alvin Lee, Chuck Berry, Larry Carlton, Elliott Smith, Carl Wilson, Eric Clapton, B. B. King, Chuck Brown, and Alex Lifeson.
